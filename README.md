So basically I set a set amount of 6 arrays and began with the first as a value of 10. 
Then the I loop the elements using the length of the arrays.
The system.out.println prints the element array in the index position like 1 would be 0 (it's the first one)and the value being 10.
The ArrayList will be able to handle more elements adding value and allowing for more resizing of the list.
